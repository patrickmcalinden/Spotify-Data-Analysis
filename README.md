<h3>Project Overview</h3>
I frequently use Spotify and I decided to utilize my "extensive history" data to interact with the API and conduct data analysis.

<h3>Setup</h3>
For this project, I have chosen to use Python for data aggregation and making API calls to supplement my dataframe. Additionally, I plan to use a combination of Excel and Tableau to create meaningful visualizations of the data.

<h3>Building</h3>
The First step was to understand the data. After that, I decided to format my data and dropped any unnecessary columns. I soon came up with the plan to get more data for my frame by interacting with the Spotify API. I used the api to pull in the artist_id and artist_genre.

<h3>Take away</h3>
This project has allowed me to brush up on my Python/Excel/Data Visualization skills before expanding my knowledge.
